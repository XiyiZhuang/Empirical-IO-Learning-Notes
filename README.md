## Notes Overview

My notes are divided into two main parts:

### 1. **Mind Maps**  

* I have created detailed mind maps summarizing the structure of each chapter from the book. These mind maps provide a clear framework of the content and can help me (and hopefully you!) quickly form an overview of the key concepts in each chapter.  

* Sections marked with an orange pencil emoji in the mind maps indicate attachments. These correspond to handwritten mathematical deductions for the associated formulas. You can find the corresponding handwritten notes in the `Mathematical Deduction` folder.  

* The mind maps are entirely in English, but the handwritten mathematical deductions include some annotations in Chinese.

### 2. **Supplementary Materials**  

I have also collected and attached some useful published lecture notes and slides that align with the content taught in each chapter in the `Supplementary Materials` folder. These materials provide additional insights and can help reinforce the concepts from the textbook.
